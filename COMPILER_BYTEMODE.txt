BYTECODE-FORMAT: Minimal/Compiler Byte Mode

Compiler Side

Compiler Byte-Mode is used to make programs even smaller, though the source code needs to account for that,
as hardcoded Data is limited to one size and addresses can not exceed a preset byte-length. The ByteCode is
prepended by a format byte. The value for Minimal Mode is 0x01, this byte is then followed by the address-space.

Runtime Side

After the Runtime has separated the Data Block and the Program Bytecode it determines which Language Processor
to use by looking at the format byte. It then sets the Memory Size to the maximum size for the set address-space,
if it exceeds it.

TL;DR

- Address Length is Limited to a user-set length in bytes
- Data Size is limited to a singular byte
- Run in custom Language Processor capable of handling this bytecode format.
